        <h2>All About Us:</h2>
        <p>
            Zeus started out in a storage room... we've grown a bunch since then! Originally, we were a designated place for students and professors to meet on middle ground and chat over a simple meal. We've preserved that legacy, but now we're also very enironmentally conscious and we strive to provide you with high-quality, local ingredients in everything we prepare for you, down to the coffee bean. That's because we love food, we love the Earth, and we love YOU, dear customer.
